FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. When listing multiple items, use proper HTML-like formatting with <ol> or <ul> list structures.
2. For market trends, use proper headings, bullet points, and clear separations between different trends.
3. Always use proper paragraph breaks for readability.
4. When comparing companies, use a clear structure with headings and subheadings.
5. Bold important points or company names using markdown format (**text**).

MARKET TRENDS FORMAT:
When discussing market trends affecting companies, use this structure:
- Start with a brief overview paragraph
- List each trend as a numbered item (1., 2., etc.)
- For each trend: Bold the trend name, then provide a concise explanation
- End with a concluding sentence or summary impact statement
